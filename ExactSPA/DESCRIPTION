Description: Calculates densities from characteristic functions with a modified inversion algorithm.
    The inversion algorithm can be viewed in two ways:
    1) Optimising the IFT integrand for good behaviour before integration (allowed due to Cauchy integral theorem).
    2) Exactly adjusting the saddlepoint approximation.
    In either case, the result is a saddlepoint adjusted inversion algorithm.
